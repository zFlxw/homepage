						My coding journey started with Minecraft Spigot plugins. I was 12 years old and I wanted
						to create my own plugins, so I started watching some tutorials on YouTube. As I had no
						knowledge of Java nor any other programming language at this points, the plugins were
						pretty bad and I had to learn a lot. <br /><br />
						After a few months of only creating plugins, I started to learn the
						<strong>Java</strong> language. It was a harsh start, I tried multiple times and failed every
						time. After each try, there were multiple breaks from coding at all, but I started over and
						over again.

					<p class="mt-4 text-xl md:text-2xl leading-9">
						After my gradution from middle school, I wanted to finally restart my coding journey. I
						found YouTube tutorials on making Discord bots in Java made by <a
							href="https://www.youtube.com/@CoasterFreakDE"
							target="_blank"
							rel="noreferrer">CoasterFreakDE</a
						>. After watching these videos, I joined his Discord server and eventually became a
						developer for the Minecraft and Discord project
						<a href="https://devsky.one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Melion</a>. <br /><br />
						Melion was a very important project for me as a developer, as I met multiple people who helped
						me improve my skills. Special thanks to
						<a href="https://github.com/DreamTexX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DreamTexX</a>,
						<a href="https://github.com/zFl4wless" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fl4wless</a>,
						<a href="https://github.com/cheetahbyte" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Leo</a>, and
						<a href="https://github.com/Morazzer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Morazzer</a>! I
						learned way more than just creating Discord bots or Minecraft plugins. For example I was
						first exposed to administrating a server, working with websockets and databases and also
						I learned a lot about API and coding principles. To sum it up, I learned more in this
						six months than in the prevoius three years.

					<h3 class="font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl mt-24">New Track Unlocked: Web Development (2022)</h3>
					<p class="mt-4 text-xl md:text-2xl leading-9">
						The time at Melion (and especially the time with <i>DreamTexX</i>) showed me that I was
						more interested in web development than in Minecraft plugins. I had some basic
						understanding of <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, but I wanted to improve
						this knowledge. My first project of 2022 was
						<a href="https://github.com/zFlxw/vocab-trainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
							>vocab-trainer</a
						>, a simple vocabulary trainer made with
						<a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VueJS</a>
						and <a href="https://expressjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ExpressJS</a>. Even
						though this project was never finished, it was a great start into web development.
						<br /><br />
						Around June, <i>Fl4wless</i> and I decided to create a new project togetherâ€”<a
							href="https://metahond.codes"
							target="_blank"
							rel="noreferrer">Metahond</a
						>. Our first project was a Discord bot, but we quickly realised that we both wanted to
						focus more on web development and a fews weeks after this, the idea of Hondicard came
						up. We started developing
						<a href="https://hondicard.metahond.codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hondicard</a
						> around August and on the 21st of January 2023, our first prototype version was finally
						released.

					<h3 class="font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl mt-24">What's Next? (2023)</h3>
					<p class="mt-4 text-xl md:text-2xl leading-9">
						2023 will be dedicated to the development of Hondicard. I am very excited to further
						improve my journey as a web developer and I am looking forward to the future. I am also
						trying to gain some knowledge in <strong>game development</strong> and
						<strong>3D-Modelling</strong>, but my main focus will be web development. One thing to
						mention here: Even though I am more of a backend developer, I am also trying to become a
						decent frontend developer.
